## Jigsaw (Improved)
This is a forked version of [Jigsaw] (https://github.com/tightenco/jigsaw) that's meants for websites with huge number of files. 

### When to use Jigsaw (Improved)
- If you are fan of a fast build time
- If you have huge number of files (more than > 500) (tested lately on 5000 files)
- If you want less memory consumption (more memory consumption leads to build crashes).
- If you build your files on production.
